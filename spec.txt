Goal of VFS:
Create a filesystem on top of another filesystem.

The Virtual Storage Drive (VSD):
An unstructured empty file with reserved space on a mounted "real" file system. It serves as an emulation of a storage device.

The VSD driver:
A piece of code that interfaces directly with the VSD. Middleware between VFS and VSD.

The Virtual File System (VFS):
The actual code that initializes/manages the VSD volume.

The User Interface (UI):
A Unix-like command line interface. It allows at least READ,WRITE,DELETE,MOVE operations.

VFS has atleast the concept of both files and directories.

===============
VSD DRIVER

The driver reads in 1 block per read, this implies that a memory buffer needs to be maintained with a size that is atleast equal to VSD block size.
